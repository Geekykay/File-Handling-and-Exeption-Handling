# 🐍 Python File Handling

---
## 📖 Overview
This project shows how to work with files in Python.
It has two main parts:
 1. File Read & Write Challenge – read from a file and write a modified version to a new file.
 2. Error Handling Lab – ask the user for a filename and handle errors if it doesn’t exist or cannot be opened.

- Modifies the content (capitalizes the first letter of each line)
- Writes the modified content to a new output file `Modified.txt`
- Handles errors like:
  - File not found

  - Unexpected exceptions
